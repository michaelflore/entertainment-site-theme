  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  First off, any television series that is based of a manga or a light novel series has enough source material for a television adaptation and
  has an excellent chance to receive a sequel. In the case of Akashic Records, it seems that the situation is in favor of the continuation of the series.
  The story is based off the light novel series which contains nine volumes to date. Meanwhile, the television adaptation covered only five of them, this means that
  we will have to wait only for one additional novel in the series before there is plenty of source material for a second season. Fortunately, Hitsuji, the author,
  publishes about two or three volumes a year. The last novel was published on the date of August 19, 2017. The new
  volume  of the light novel came out in the previous year 2018. This is excellent news for the fans!
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Another thing we should first consider is the dvd sales. So far, last year about 500 copies were sold. This means that Akashic Records ranked 27th place competing with
  other anime like Sword Art Online, triage X, and Trinity Seven. Even though it may not seem impressive, Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor ranked 70th place among all the
  anime series in the stats table. This being said, we believe that Liden films is about to produce one more season for Akashic Records.
  With plenty of source material, excellent response from the audience, as well as great number of sales, the only thing left for them to do is confirm the release
  of the new season.

  <h2>Akashic Records Of Bastard Magic Instructor Plot Summary</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The story begins in the Alzano Imperial Magic Academy, a school where certain aspiring students tend to perfect their skills. The plot revolves around Sistine Fibel,
  a promising skilled magician, who enrolls together with her friend Rumia Tingel. Intending to improve their magical experience, they encounter the
  unexpected turn of their favorite teacher mysteriously disappearing, and a new professor named Glenn Radars comes to replace him. It seems that he is
  not interested in magic even in the slightest way. With that being said, a conflict arises between Glenn and his new students.
  </p>



  <h2>Akashic Records Of Bastard Magic Instructor Season 2 Release Date</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  So far, only one volume remained to be the issue to produce another television adaptation of Akashic Records. Since the recent light novel came out at the beginning
  of 2018, the creators thereby need at least a year to produce a brand new season. As a result, we predict the release date of Akashic Records Season 2 for the <mark>beginning of 2020</mark>.
  However, perhaps we will get lucky and the studio will hurry to release the next installment by this fall of 2019. So far, we are waiting for an official announcement, and will
  inform you as soon as we can obtain any reliable information on the topic.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Akashic Records Season 2 is highly unlikely to be released before the year 2020. Although, historically the author
  Hitsuji has published two to three volumes a year, this means that by the end of this year there could be four volumes transformed into another season.
  If the pacing speeds up, and some of the previously skipped plot is incorporated we could hear a new season confirmation soon!

  <h2>Akashic Records Of Bastard Magic Instructor Season 2 Release Date updates 2019</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  As of the latest update, another factor to consider is the money. Some fans argue that the anime is simply serving as an advertisement for the light novels and manga, but it is highly possible
  the series dvd sales in Japan could all in the top 10. Good sales will of course be a huge factor to decide on whether or not create a second season. The Japanese release
  date for the dvd was recently back in June 28, 2017,so do not lose hope just yet.
