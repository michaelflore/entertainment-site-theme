  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Seraph Of The End is a Japanese dark fantasy manga series illustrated by Yamato Yamamoto and written by Takaya Kagami. The Seraph Of the End anime series had
  released back in the year 2015, originally being produced by Wit Studio and aired on June 20, 2015. The anime quickly saw a tremendous growth in popularity soon
  after the first season came to a close. The producers since then decided that a second season would take place. Unfortunately, the second season was not quite as
  successful as the first but the large fan base resulting from the previous seasons had remained the same. The real question that draws the attention of many is if there
  will be a third season of the anime series.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  When talking about the source material, the original manga as well as light novel is still going on. However, the last chapter titled Seraph Of The End Guren Ichinose
  World Resurrection was later announced as a spinoff series.  Wit Studio or any other animation studio which might potentially produce another television
  adaptation is required the source material to make 24 episodes, or at the very least 12 episodes. More volumes of the manga must be released in order to create another season.
  </p>



  <h2>Seraph Of The End Plot Summary</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The story takes place in 2012, when a human made virus spreads all over the world and gradually leads to the destruction of the earth. This leaves children under
  the age of 13 being the only ones alive. Vampires then arise from the corner of the earth, and follow around a boy named Yuichiro Hyakuya who lives in an orphanage. When he and his
  friend Mikaela were twelve, they had escaped with other children from the orphanage. However, things do not go smoothly and everyone ends up dyings except for Mikaela and
  Yuichiro. Finally, Mikaela sacrifices himself for his friend and dies aswell. He escapes and later ends up being rescued by the members of the Moon Demon Company.
  </p>

  <h2>Seraph Of The End Season 3 Release Date</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The Season 3 for the series Seraph Of The End has not been announced yet. There are release date speculations about when there will be a sequel and there are also some
  rumors too, that season 3 will be <mark>premiered in 2019</mark>, according to other sources. However, this information has not been confirmed by the studio, cast members, or producers
  of the series. So far it is tough to say whether there will be a season three, as the creators and studio have been unheard from and have been kept silent.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  On the other hand, the first season kicked off in April 2015, so we might expect the new season to premiere in the spring of 2019 to say the least.
  Still though, such scenario is quite unlikely, in our opinion. If a season 3 were to happen soon if would happen no earlier than <mark>Fall of 2019</mark>.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  As of right now, a lack of material for the sequel is not the only thing that is preventing the anime to be continued. In fact, the first season was a lot more
  popular as it received a lot better ratings than it did with the sequel. Something like this needs to be avoided with Seraph Of The End Season 3 if the series
  were to continue and be successful.
  </p>



  <h2>Seraph Of The End Season 3 Release Date updates 2019</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  As of the latest update there has been no official announcement of the series cancellation. However, in the
  case of Seraph Of The End season 3, the odds are basically low at this rate. It is quite unlikely that we might see Seraph Of The End Season 3 in 2019. If there
  is any word from the studio or announcements, this article will be updated as soon as it is confirmed with all the relevant information.
