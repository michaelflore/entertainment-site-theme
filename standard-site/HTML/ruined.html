  <h2>1: Celebrity game designers</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The first company to give designers credit for their software was Activision, and in the decades since their founding, the cult of the game designer
  has only grown. The thing is, no one person is responsible for the success or failure of a big-budget game. That didn�t stop us from canonizing game
  developers as the celebrities of the industry. The nadir probably came in the late 90s with John Romero making you his dog with Daikatana, but people
  like Peter Molyneux should make us very cautious of putting too much trust in any designer who puts their personality over their games.
  </p>

  <h2>2: Long cutscenes</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The whole point of video games is that they let you influence a living story with your own skill and decisions. So why is just about every game that hits
  the market now loaded down with non-interactive cutscenes that play the game for you? Pac-Man had brief animated segments in between sets of levels, which
  grew and grew until some games like Metal Gear Solid 4 have a staggering 71 minutes of cutscene. Lets face it: many video game designers are lousy movie
  directors, and they should stick with what they know.
  </p>

  <h2>3: Online gaming causing dehumanization</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  When you wanted to play games against people twenty years ago, you did it in the arcade, where you had to look your opponent in the eye, win or lose. PC gaming
  had an equivalent with the LAN party, where gamers got together and brought their boxes to a big room to play Quake and Marathon. But as internet connection speeds
  increased, we stopped doing that and instead turned to competing online. Not being in the same room as the person you�re fragging is innately dehumanizing, creating
  a generation of gamers whose main social interaction is yelling racial slurs over Xbox Live.
  </p>

  <h2>4: DLC</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  In the old days, when you bought a game you knew exactly what you were getting a complete experience that was worth the money. With the introduction of downloadable
  content, though, now your $60 doesnt even get you the whole game. Publishers now expect to be able to bilk more cash out of gullible gamers a nickel and dime at a
  time with downloadable content. This varies from cosmetic additions that you can live without to great heaping lumps of game. Now you can even buy fighting games
  where you have to pay extra for each combatant, and we�re not even going into the worst kind of DLC, where publishers make you pay just to unlock stuff thats already
  on the game disc
  </p>

  <h2>5: Microtransactions</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Once game publishers learned that they could get money out of us even after we bought the game, the floodgates were opened for all kinds of extra charges. Probably
  the most odious are microtransactions, which we see a lot in mobile gaming but are starting to make their way into console and PC titles as well. One of the worst
  microtransactions are the ones that give you an advantage in the game, completely removing the need for skill entirely. If you�re not playing a game to get better
  at it, whats the point? You might as well be watching anime on Netflix. Even worse, though, are the microtransactions that are basically required to progress in a
  game.
