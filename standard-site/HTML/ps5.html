  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  PS5 release date and price rumours are rife and analysts remain divided over when the new console will arrive.
  The official Sony reveal could happen at any time during the coming months, and there are some that believe we could even see a shock launch date announced.
  Following news of the slowing PS4 sales earlier this month, some analysts have backed Sony to move toward a new console platform.
  The costs of this process have started to be factored in, and some analysts believe that the PS5 could arrive in the next fiscal year for Sony.
  This is partly the reason behind the drop in the Sony Corp. share price, the biggest since 2015, while other factors concerning declining demand for parts also played a role.
  </p>

  <h2>Playstation 5 Release Date 2019</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  This news comes as Sony looks to change key staff ahead of the console transition expected in the future.
  The gaming division will see Jim Ryan become its new president and CEO in April, taking up the reigns from John Kodera.
  The previous head of Sony Interactive Entertainment global sales sounds like a good pick to oversee the launch of the PlayStation 5.
  He may also play a role in expanding the PlayStation Network, which has become a massive growth area for Sony.
  A recent statement made by Sony President and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida reflects this and is something that could nod to its importance for the next console too.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  "Our Game & Network Services business has grown into the Sony Group's largest business in terms of both sales and operating income," Yoshida said in a recent statement.
  "Furthermore, our business in this domain holds significant importance as our growth driver going forward."
  "At the same time, this industry is relentlessly fast-moving, and to remain the market leader, we must constantly evolve ourselves with a sense of urgency."
  Another analyst has had a crack at predicting the PlayStation 5 price point when it launches, another massive factor in its success.
  A gap between the cost of the PS5 and Xbox Two could create a clear advantage for the system that proves cheapest to buy.
  Ace Research Institute Analyst Hideki Yasuda believes that the price will be less than $500, or at least on par with the PS4 at launch.
  However, a sub-$500 price point suggests that the PlayStation 5 won't be quite the powerhouse hoped for, or that the company are willing to make a loss on the console.
  This could be achieved if the games and services side of things could cover the costs.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Likewise, it was recently suggested that year-on-year video game revenue could drop for the first time since the mid-90s.
  London research firm Pelham Smithers believes the market will shrink in 2019 and 2020.
  Smithers blames ageing PS4 and Xbox One consoles, a lack of blockbuster releases and Fortnite-fatigue for the potential drop in revenue.
  Mobile gaming is also expected to take a hit in China, as a stricter new approvals system comes into force.
  This decline is expected to continue until the year following the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Two.
