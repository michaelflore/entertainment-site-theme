  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Kingdom Hearts III has finally been released and out in the wild for a few weeks now, so you've perhaps had time to work your way through Square Enix's long-awaited JRPG, or at least make a decent dent in it.
  And though the game received strong reviews for the most part, as a fan, it's hard not to feel short-changed by the end result.
  Is Kingdom Hearts III a terrible game? Absolutely not, but does it live up to more than a decade of hype and meet the high standard set by its predecessors? Not nearly.
  This is a game as frustrating as it is entertaining, loaded with mind-boggling design and creative decisions which hamper the core experience.
  Though Square Enix is to be commended for the title's terrific visuals and grind-free gameplay, getting to the end of the 30-hour adventure is more of an exercise in patience than anyone wants to admit.
  Between this and the underwhelming Final Fantasy XV, it really feels like the company needs a major creative overhaul if they're going to maintain their status as a top-tier AAA publisher...
  </p>

  <h2>5 The Disney Worlds Are Bad</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Monstropolis was a colossal disappointment, taking the vibrant world of Monsters Inc. and boiling it down into a series of dull, repetitive factory hallways that proves oddly reminiscent of FFXV's infamous, soul-destroying Chapter 13.
  Frozens Arendelle was also a major letdown, consisting of little more than copy-paste tundra environments while the player is simply tasked with running up and down a stretch of mountain.
  And the games trip to 100 Acre Wood is meanwhile shockingly brief, forcing the player to spend most of their time playing soulless, unimaginative mini-games.
  Too many of the worlds just lazily retell the story from their respective movies, and the expected intertextuality with Sora's own story isn't really there.
  To this end the game too often feels like lazy Disney fan service rather than an inventive collision of two distinct properties.
  </p>

  <h2>4 No Final Fantasy Characters</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Perhaps the most obvious complaint about Kingdom Hearts III is the total lack of Final Fantasy characters in the game (apart from the shopkeeper Moogles, of course).
  Including characters from Square Enix's beloved JRPG franchise has been a staple of the Kingdom Hearts games, so their complete absence here is just bizarre.
  Considering the tried-and-tested awesomeness of combining Final Fantasy with Disney, it's extremely odd that the likes of Cloud and Sephiroth are nowhere to be seen.
  Yes, you can argue that their stories have been tied up already, but in a game that's all about fan service, that's an indulgence it could've easily gotten away with.
  Its probably more likely that the Final Fantasy aspect was cut during production given the game's noted developmental issues, because from a marketing perspective, cramming as much Disney into the game as possible was the obvious priority.
  </p>

  <h2>3  The Pacing Is Terrible</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The main problem is the utterly wonky pacing, with the majority of the Disney-themed worlds presenting little in the way of concrete story progression, before the final few hours of the game rush through enough epic incident and character development to fill an entire RPG.
  It basically feels like Square Enix is just ticking things off in those later hours, bombarding the player with relentless battles and exposition dumps without much of a reprieve.
  Had the story been doled out more evenly between worlds, then the game surely wouldn't seem so genuinely boring with such baffling regularity.
  </p>

  <h2>2 The Boss Fights Are Really Underwhelming</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Square Enix is of course renowned for their creative and memorable boss fights, but again like FFXV, Kingdom Hearts 3 falls massively short of the mark in this area.
  Despite having numerous iconic Disney IP at their disposal, most of the themed worlds don't present much in the way of awe-inspiring bosses, mostly settling for giant and/or dark versions of creatures you've already encountered.
  Only really at the tail-end of the game do the boss fights truly boast the epic scale you'd hope for, yet given the easy potential for some creative battles against some of Disney's most memorable recent villains, they mostly feel like a hugely missed opportunity.
  </p>

  <h2>1 The Finale Is A Fan Service Money Grab</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  No spoilers here, but the final 3-4 hours of Kingdom Hearts 3 are an absolute chore. Though its hardly difficult, the player is assaulted with more than a dozen boss fights, most of them punctuated by exhaustingly over-baked cut-scenes.
  Between the simplicity of the fights, their general repetitiveness and the lack of imagination on display, Square Enix clearly would've benefited from a less-is-more approach to the game's finale.
  By the time the ending finally rolls around, you may find yourself more relieved that the tiresome avalanche of soulless fights and nonsensical dialogues is over, which is a damn shame.
