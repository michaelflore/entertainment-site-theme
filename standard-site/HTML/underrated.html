  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Though well have to wait at least another year before the jury hands in their verdict on this generation of consoles, its fair to say its been a divisive one.
  Everyone has their favourite games, but it feels as though the last four years have been more polarised than most. Metacritic averages, user scores and the flow of online chatter have all contributed to the sense that,
  when any game releases, a divisive response could lie in wait. This counts for titles both triple-A and otherwise, and though there's no denying that many games of the last generation certainly deserve criticism, the fact that
  so many met a negative or even lukewarm reaction, just seems like a step too far. This isnt to be confused with some of the PS4s most overlooked titles either.
  Though that is a topic worth discussing, games that fell afoul of the Metacritic average is our primary concern today. Its been five years of highs and lows for
  Sonys latest console, but with underrated titles both exclusive and otherwise, the PS4s library of soon-to-be-forgotten classics grows by the day.
  </p>

  <h2>1: The Evil Within 2</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The sequel to 2014s Evil Within might be able to boast a cult following, but its yet to achieve the mainstream recognition it sorely deserves.
  Though it isnt without its flaws, the Shinji Mikami sequel is a compelling third-person horror title and one that manages to retain its drive from start to finish, with only a few wobbles in between.
  Yes, those final corridor-sequences aren't as exciting as the titles earlier moments, but The Evil Within II is atmospheric above all else, having picked up three or so years after the finale of the first game.
  Its not a sequel just for the hardcore either, as although the lore is certainly deep, it doesnt take long to get to grips with, lending this particular horror title an appeal others in the genre can lack at times
  particularly so, once you factor in its intuitive combat mechanics.
  </p>

  <h2>2: Infamous First Light</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Sucker Punch may look set to bring a new IP to market in the stunning Ghost of Tsushima, but there was another Sony exclusive that used to get PS4 owners really excited.
  inFAMOUS hasnt been heard from since First Light dropped in 2014, and thats a massive shame for all concerned. The series, which took inspiration from the superhero genre of comic books, was a staple of the PlayStation 3 before debuting
  on the current gen with Second Son - a title that managed to nail an average rating of 80 on Metacritic. The sequels spin-off, First Light, didnt fare as well (even though it probably should have).
  Acting as a prequel to Second Son, First Light followed Abigail Fetch Walker in the events leading to her meeting with Delsin. Criticism at the time came down to the fact that, having given players such a wide array of powers in Second Son,
  only being able to use one of them with Fetch seemingly presented a step-back for the series.
  It worked within the context of the story though, and while First Light isn't discussed much these days, its a worthy addition to the inFAMOUS lore and one worth any fans attention, especially with the price it's available for these days.
  </p>

  <h2>3: Until Dawn</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Until Dawn is just about the best horror title the PS4 has, and yet its not held in nearly as high a regard as it should be.
  Though the game fared well among most critics, it fell short of a Metacritic average of 80, sitting just below on 79. Though such a minuscule difference shouldnt
  denote the difference between a good game and a great one, its fair to say that Until Dawns cult status amongst gamers and horror fans in particular has
  cemented its status as a forgotten classic, and as an IP Sony have failed to ever properly capitalise on.
  A point-and-click horror title that should never be spoiled for those yet to play it, Until Dawn features the talents of Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Brett
  Dalton and Peter Stormare as a group of teens set up camp in a house on a haunted hill with a dark past. The game only gets zanier and more terrifying from
  there on in, with every decision the player makes having the potential to be a matter of life and death.
  With star power, atmosphere and horror aplenty, Until Dawn is the must-have exclusive PlayStation owners cant afford to miss, and a title long overdue a
  genuine sequel.
  </p>

  <h2>4: Assassins Creed Syndicate</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Assassins Creed Syndicate is just about the best AC game everyone seemed to miss, and its all thanks to the fallout surrounding Unity.
  Unity, which was Ubisofts first current gen Creed title, was panned for numerous reasons, not least because the launch edition was a buggy, unplayable mess.
  That reputation unfortunately carried over for Syndicate, which released just a year after Ubi buggishly broached the French Revolution during a period in which
  annualisation was coming under heavy scrutiny. The fact that it innovated in a great many areas didn't seem to matter, and neither did its fantastic recreation
  of Victorian London - franchise fatigue had set in, and Syndicate, unfortunately, was its first victim.
  Releasing in 2015, Syndicate told the story of Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigated Templar-controlled London during the closing decade of the nineteenth century.
  It was a fantastic exploration of the city, and with players being able to switch between Jacob and Evie at the flick of a switch, each boasting distinct play-styles,
  the title provided the rejuvenating kick the franchise sorely needed two years before Origins released.
  </p>

  <h2>5: Mafia III</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Hangar 13s first foray into the world of 2K's mobster series was anticipated for a whole host of reasons, not least of which because LucasArts alum and comic
  book writer Haden Blackman would be heading development. Together with the rest of 13, who assembled colleagues formerly of LucasArts and 2K Czech, Blackman
  set out to tell the story of Lincoln Clay - a Vietnam veteran who falls in with the Black Mob on the eve of the United States' most tumultuous year: 1968.
  Gameplay wise, yes, it did leave some things to be desired. The open world looked impressive but gameplay could get repetitive at times. That said, combat
  felt fast, impactful and frenetic, and the overarching narrative surrounding Clays revenge was among the most compelling the medium has ever seen.
  Treat Mafia III as a story worth exploring, and its impossible not to appreciate. Throw in all the DLC for good measure, and taking another trip to
  New Bordeaux is pretty much a no-brainer, even if it didn't look an enticing prospect in 2016.
