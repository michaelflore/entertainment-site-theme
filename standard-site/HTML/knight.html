  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Perhaps you may be aware that Chivalry of a Failed Knight light novel series was sold in Japan with a grand total of 1.8 million copies. However, the
  television adaptation anime was not so much impressive in sales. The first season of the anime series came to an end on December 19, 2015.
  Since then, numerous fans have been trying to figure out whether or not Nexus is going to produce another season.
  Unfortunately, there have been no official announcements about Season 2 so far. However, we can now think a little bit about whether or not there
  will be a next season. As usual, there is a variety of factors capable of affecting the decision on the renewal.
  </p>



  <h2>Chivalry of a Failed Knight Plot</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The entire story then unfolds in a parallel universe, where humans with supernatural capabilities called blazers exist. Their primary ability is to control a weapon
  called called a device, which is a derivative of ones soul. This anime starts the plot in which Ikki Kurogane goes to a school for magical knights. It is not easy for
  everybody to control their own magic and Ikki out of them all is probably the worst in
  the school. He does not have any magical skills, and he is not very good when it comes to the usage of weapons. One day he meets Stella Vermillion, a foreign
  princess and the best student in the entire school. From there on, Ikki is challenged to a duel and the two battle it out. The rules were pretty simple, the one
  who will lose in the tournament becomes the slave of the winner. The story thus describes Ikkis attempt to prove his
  significance, being the weakest among the strongest students.

  <h2>Chivalry of a Failed Knight Season 2 Release Date</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  As mentioned above, we do not want to rule out the possibility of Chivalry of a Failed Knight returning for Season 2. Most of the series produced by the company go on
  a long term hiatus before getting a new installment. In general, the odds are strong, given all the facts presented above nobody knows the future for sure. The
  company has been kept quiet recently and neither Silver Link nor Nexus are in a hurry for the announcement of a new season.
  </p>




  <h2>Chivalry of a Failed Knight Season 2 Release Date Speculation</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  It is possible that Chivalry of a Failed Knight will not return for Season 2 this year. However, maybe 2019 will be a more successful for this anime series. We are eagerly
  waiting for the official announcement by the comapny. We will inform you about the long awaited official announcement as soon as possible with an updated article. If the
  studio were to announce a renewal of the series sometime in 2019, then it would take a year for them to finish. This would mean the release date would not come out until
  the year 2020.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  In addition, the first season ended up with many unclear issues. This fact also reserves a chance to see the continuation of the sequel as there are many questions for
  the story to be answered. The original version debuted in October practically the same time with the anime, Asterisk War. Hopefully, the release of season 2 will take place
  around the same month this year. As for the Chivalry of a Failed Knight Season 2 spoilers, there is not much to speculate on. The light novel seems to have plenty of source
  material in order to produce another season so hopefully in the near future we see a release date!
