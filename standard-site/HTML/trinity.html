  This release date is just a speculation and the next fall or even the beginning of 2020 is the most likely th predicted release date for the new season. In the meantime,
  we are waiting for the official news confirmation. Once the announcement is made this article will be updates as soon as possbile. Until then stay tuned for updates.

   <h2>Trinity Seven Season 2 Updates</h2>

   <p style="font-size:18px;">
   As always there are rumors going around that the anime is going to be premiered on <mark>April 11, 2019</mark>, however, this is not an official announcement. The main
   reason why there is no Season 2 is that there are license problems. Crunchyroll first obtained the license, but in 2015 Madman Entertainment bought obtained the rights for the anime.
   After that, another company named Sentai Filmworks took over in 2016 in order to continue the unfinished project. The current owner of the anime is now KSM Anime, starting from the year of 2017.
   Fans are still hoping that there is going to be a Trinity Seven Season 2 in the near future. So far there is a second film adaptation from the current manga, which might be a way to test if there
   are enough fans of the show. If the movie gets a positive rating, we can ceratinly predict a new season of Trinity Seven.
