  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Classroom of the Elite is an anime series based on a Japanese graphic light novel. Just like many of its simliar series, the show includes a lot of action as
  well as some interesting storyline drama. In particular, the plot of the story is something that is worth paying attention to. The series is highly rated amongst
  the anime fans and many are hoping for a another season. Depending on what genre you are interested in this is definitely an anime worth watching.
  </p>

  <h2>Classroom of the Elite Plot</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The story takes place in the future of Japan at Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced High School. This institution serves as a way into
  the future for the gifted students. The Japanese government considers this high school as an opportunity to raise the next generation of elite students who will
  be able to represent the country in the near future. The students there possess an incredible amount of freedom since they can wear what they want and behave as
  they please. In fact, there is a bit of injustice at the school since there are four grades of classes, from A to D. As you may have guessed, the D class
  is the worst one. The story focuses on Kiyotaka Ayanokouji, a shy boy who was unlucky to be among the students to be considered in the D class. He is not great at making
  new friends. However, when Kiyotaka encounters Suzune, who believes that she has been mistakenly placed in D class, his life begins to improve.
  </p>



  <h2>Classroom of the Elite Season 2 Release Date</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  As of the last update, studio Lerche or any company related to the production of the anime has not officially confirmed the Classroom Of The Elite Season 2 release
  date. Once the news is officially confirmed this article will be updated with all the relevant information. In the meantime, it is possible to speculate about when
  the season 2 premiere date will occur in the future. The anime was the most popular Crunchyroll series in the fall of 2017. The first six books were reprinted during that time frame and they
  reached the top 30 on the anime charts for Japanese sales. The combined sales reached into the millions, so it is certain the light novel series will not be canceled
  any time soon.
  </p>


  <h2>Classroom of the Elite Season 2 Release Date Speculation</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  We do not want rule out that Classroom of the Elite Season 2 could possibly happen due to the very favorable statistics of the anime. Lerche has yet to announce their
  decision on the subject. However, in the case of renewal, we suppose that Classroom Of The Elite could return for a second season this or next summer, most likely,
  in <mark>July of 2019</mark>. We do not know for sure how much time it could take time to produce one more season of Classroom of the Elite. Therefore,
  we are looking forward to the official announcement of Lerche.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Studio Lerche released four anime in 2017, including Classroom Of The Elite, and they are scheduled to release four more in 2018. On the off chance that production
  of Classroom Of The Elite Season 2 is being considered, it seems reasonable to speculate that the release date will be in 2020 at the absolute earliest.
