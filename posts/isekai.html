  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The Isekai wa Smartphone Season 2 release cant come any sooner now that anime fans are eagerly waiting for a given hint about Babylon and
  the upcoming adventure. The In Another World With My Smartphone anime may have started off a bit slow based on the plot, but the light
  novel has been very consistent that should pick up the storys pace in the upcoming second season. There will also be brand new
  giant robot mecha battles giving the anime a huge plot twist!
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  People have a tendency to fall into one of two categories when it comes to this show. They either think it is the best
  thing that they have seen in a very long time or they are completely underwhelmed by it. There is not really much in the
  way of middle fan base here. Some people consider it as the worst series they have ever watched and others have been
  anticipating for a second season, hoping and praying with each passing day that news of a season two would finally come along.
  For a long time, there has not been much said about it and fans had started to wonder whether or not a season two is in the
  works. Finally, there has been some news starting to out and it is the type of news that should make fans happy.

  <h2>Isekai Wa Smartphone Plot</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  The protagonist of the anime is a teenager named Toya Motizuki who is in trouble. Toya Mochizuki did not think that he was going to die at the age of 15.
  The guy was struck by lightning, which was shot by God. God was terribly in regret because murdering the young man was not part of his plans, and he offered
  Toya to resurrect him in another world, and even allowed to take one thing with him. Toya asked for his smartphone in which he wanted to use it to call home,
  but it did not work out since the smartphone only showed maps, searched for information, and connected him to God. God was also kind enough to give the guy
  magic powers, quick reaction, and intelligence. At first, from the very first minutes of his appearance in the new world Toya was known as a hero as easily dealt
  with bandits, wild animals, and monsters. Very soon there were a lot of girls around him and the local
  king proclaimed the boy as his successor. Toya Motizuki began to solve riddles of the parallel world, and to study the magic of ancient civilizations, the guy found new friends, among
  them was the sister of the twin Siroesuka.

  <h2>Isekai Wa Smartphone Season 2 Release Date</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  As of the lastest update, Production Reed or any company related to the production of the anime has not officially confirmed or announced the new Isekai wa
  Smartphone Season 2, nor the release date. Many uncredited news sources claim that the release date of the new season will be held on <mark>July 15, 2019</mark> but it is
  likely that this information is false. Once the news is officially confirmed this article will be updated with the relevant information. In the meantime, its
  possible to speculate about when the Isekai Smartphone Season 2 premiere date will occur in the future.
  </p>




  <h2>Isekai Wa Smartphone Season 2 Release Date Speculation</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  Usually an anime series has blu ray sales in Japan during the first week that are often used as a benchmark for financial success. Unfortunately, the first blu ray
  volume of Isekai Wa Smartphone did merely okay, selling just 1,418 copies. Those numbers are not considered fantastic, but there may still be a chance for a second
  season since international streaming rights have changed the industry greatly in recent years and streaming revenue is often the majority of income for animes. The light
  novel series of the anime is what is keeping it alive at the moment, as it is constantly producing new content and developing the potential plot for a second season.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:18px;">
  In addition, the season one finale did seem to end on a hopeful note. It is possible Production Reed is hoping to continue the story considering that the ending had
  Touya meeting a major new character during the after credits scene. It is certainly possible that a season 2 is being considered at the moment by the company. For now
  anime fans will have to wait a little bit longer to find out. A likely predicted release date can be in the <mark>summer of 2020</mark>.
